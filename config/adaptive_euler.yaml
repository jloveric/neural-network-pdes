# Configuration for Euler PDE with AdaptivePiecewiseMLP
# This config is used by the adaptive_euler.py script

# Network configuration
network:
  hidden_layers: [40, 40, 40]  # Sizes of hidden layers
  num_points: 10               # Initial number of points for piecewise functions
  position_range: [-1, 1]      # Range of positions for piecewise functions
  anti_periodic: false         # Whether to use anti-periodic boundary conditions
  position_init: "uniform"     # Initialization method for positions
  normalization: "noop"        # Normalization type (noop, maxabs)

# Adaptive configuration
adaptive:
  enabled: true                # Whether to use adaptive point management
  frequency: 1                # Apply adaptation every N batches
  move_smoothest: true         # Whether to move smoothest points
  move_smoothest_after: 1    # Start moving smoothest points after N epochs
  threshold: 0.1               # Threshold for moving points (ratio of min/max error)

# Physics configuration
physics:
  gamma: 1.4
  artificial_viscosity: 0.0

# When this value is 0, no loss reduction occurs with time
# when set to 0, the final state hardly contributes to the loss
time_decay: 0.0

# Inputs are normalized to [-1, 1] so we need to scale the time
# and space derivatives. X is [-1, 1] and t is [0, 1] so t has
# a scale factor of 0.5
scale_x: 1
scale_t: 0.25

# pde weighting
loss_weight:
  interior: 0.1
  boundary: 10
  initial: 10

# Form of equations, conservative or primitive
form: "conservative"
solve_waves: true

# Delta, offset for computing derivatives
delta: 0.01
delta_t: 0.01

# generate this many interior data points
data_size: 10000

# Training configuration
max_epochs: 5000
accelerator: cuda
batch_size: 1024
learning_rate: 1e-4
optimizer: "adam"

# gradient clipping
gradient_clip: 0.0 #5.0

# Are you training? Otherwise plot the result
train: true
checkpoint: null
save_images: true
save_frequency: 50

# Hydra configuration
